								<ol>
									<li class="fragment fade-up"><span><b>Interest and explanation </b></span>– “When our interest is aroused in something, whether it is an academic subject or a hobby, we enjoy working hard at it. We come to feel that we can in some way own it and use it to make sense of the world around us.”</li>
									<li class="fragment fade-up"><span><b>Appropriate assessment and feedback</b></span> – This principle involves using a variety of assessment techniques and allowing students to demonstrate their mastery of the material in different ways. It avoids those assessment methods that encourage students to memorize and regurgitate. It recognizes the power of feedback to motivate more effort to learn.</li>
									<li class="fragment fade-up"><span><b>Clear goals and intellectual challenge</b></span>– Effective teachers set high standards for students. They also articulate clear goals. Students should know up front what they will learn and what they will be expected to do with what they know.</li>
									<li class="fragment fade-up"><span><b>Learning from students </b></span>– “Effective teaching refuses to take its effect on students for granted. It sees the relation between teaching and learning as problematic, uncertain and relative.</li>
									<li class="fragment fade-up"><span><b>Independence, control and active engagement</b></span> – Good teachers create learning tasks appropriate to the student’s level of understanding. They also recognize the uniqueness of individual learners and avoid the temptation to impose “mass production” standards that treat all learners as if they were exactly the same.</li>

								<div>
									<p>Active Learning</p>
										<ul>
											<li class="fragment fade-up">Active learning refers to a broad range of teaching strategies which engage students as active participants in their learning during class time with their instructor. Typically, these strategies involve some amount of students working together during class, but may also involve individual work and/or reflection. </li>
										</ul>
								</div>
								<div>
									<p>Passive Learning</p>
										<ul>
											<li class="fragment fade-up">Passive learning is a method of learning or instruction where students receive information from the instructor and internalize it. It is a method "where the learner receives no feedback from the instructor</li>

										<p>Active Learning</p>
										<ul>
											<li class="fragment fade-up">Active learning allows for frequent feedback, stimulates attention, participation and discussion, and develops critical thinking.</li>
											<br>
											<p class="fragment fade-down" style="font-weight: bold;">DISAVANTAGE</p>
											<li class="fragment fade-down"> Active learning does not allow for a well-planned lesson, students may become distracted and the amount of information shared is minimal.</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
									<div>
										<p>Passive Learning</p>
										<ul>
											<li class="fragment fade-up"> Passive learning allows for more information to be presented, gives the teacher more control, and allows for an organized presentation of the topic.</li>
											<br>
											<p class="fragment fade-down" style="font-weight: bold;">DISAVANTAGE</p>
											<li class="fragment fade-down">Passive learning may become boring, students become disengaged, knowledge gained may be superficial, and there is minimal feedback.</li>
